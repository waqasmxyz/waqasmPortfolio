            <h2 class="mainheadings">Hello! I'm Waqas M.</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">I'm a passionate and motivated Junior Full Stack Developer with a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end technologies. I recently transitioned from a successful career as a 3D Artist and Game Level Designer, where I honed my technical skills and developed a keen eye for detail.

                With a background in creating immersive game environments and leading international teams, I bring a unique perspective to web development. My experience in the gaming industry has equipped me with robust problem-solving abilities, creative thinking, and a collaborative mindset, all of which I am eager to apply in the world of full stack development. <br><br>
                
                I am proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and various frameworks and libraries such as Django. I thrive in dynamic environments and am always excited to tackle new challenges and learn new technologies.
                
                As I embark on this new journey, I am enthusiastic about contributing to innovative projects, collaborating with talented teams, and continuing to grow as a developer.</p>
                
                <h3 class="mainheadings">Why change careers?</h3>
                <p class="paragraph">I spent over a decade as a 3D Artist and Game Level Designer, working extensively with Unity 3D, Unreal Engine, and Blender 3D since 2012. During this time, I led an international team to develop and publish two games on consoles, one of which was selected for a physical release on PlayStation Vita. Due to a significant crisis in the gaming industry, I made the strategic decision to transition my career to full stack development. This shift has allowed me to leverage my technical and creative skills in new and exciting ways. After more than a decade of enriching experience in the gaming industry, I have embraced the challenge of transitioning to full stack development. Leading international teams and publishing successful games has equipped me with strong leadership and teamwork skills. This journey has been driven by my passion for technology and my commitment to continuous learning. I am excited to bring my unique blend of creativity and technical skills to new opportunities in web development.</p>
